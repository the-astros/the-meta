## this is a story about stories

this is a story of how we came to tell stories
and how we can live our best stories


## the first story is the story of difference

all of our landmarks for navigating stories
from begining and end
to up and down
from hot and cold
to near and far
reference gradients of difference we see in the world around us

the first story is of the birth of the cosmos
in the great cataclysm
when the undifferentiated mass of dust
split into two families
forming the stars and the void

in that moment all of the dust in the cosmos
burst from everywhere to somewhere
and it was crowded and hot
and the stars rejoiced and pulled together
but the void recoiled and pushed away

the dust boiled in difference and split again
the void cooled and tore the early sea of starfire apart
into clumps that burst across the cosmos
and fried into light and mud
that exploded into the space and time
between the roiling furnaces of the stars

except in the great maelstroms
where gathering grains of star dust
so overwhelm the grid of the fleeing void
that space and time are pushed aside
and the fossil of a star lays in the space of a hand

this great struggle
between the hungry stars
and the cold void
bore the spinning galaxies from a cataclysm of fire
toward a cold and lonely death in the distant future
and sets the stage
upon which all other stories are told


## the second story is the story of life

difference is the wellspring of energy potential
that feeds the wheel of life



## the third story is the story of culture
