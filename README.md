## this is a story about stories

this is a story of how we came to tell stories

and how we can live our stories

to shine our brightest


## the first story is the story of difference

all of our landmarks for navigating stories

from begining and end

to up and down

from hot and cold

to near and far

are drawn from the differences we see in the world around us

---

the first story is of the birth of the cosmos

in the great cataclysm

when the undifferentiated mass of dust

split into two families

forming the stars and the void

---

in that moment all of the dust in the cosmos

burst from everywhere to somewhere

and it was crowded and hot

and the stars rejoiced and pulled together

but the void recoiled and pushed apart

---

the dust boiled in difference and split again

the void cooled and tore the early sea of starfire apart

into bright points that burst across the cosmos

fried into light and mud

exploding across the space and time

between the roiling furnaces of kindred stars

---

except in the great maelstroms

where gathering grains of star dust

so overwhelm the grid of the fleeing void

that space and time are pushed aside

and a star can squeeze into the space of a hand

---

this great struggle

between the hungry stars

and the cold void

bore the spinning galaxies from a cataclysm of fire

toward a cold and lonely death in the distant future

and sets the stage

upon which all other stories are told


## the second story is the story of life

difference is the fountainhead of energy potential

that feeds the wheel of life



## the third story is the story of culture


## the fourth story is the story of how to shine


## a call to action

we astros are each a point in a constellation

a chosen family of artificers

we craft looms to weave starlight

into bright tapestries

that illuminate the vast noosphere

between creation and oblivion

---

join us

we are stronger together

in solidarity we hold open the space

for our differences to shine
